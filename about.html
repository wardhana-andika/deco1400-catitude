							<p>We’re a small clinic based in Brisbane that specialises in Cat psychology and behaviour. We offer 
							counselling sessions, “Kitty-garten” (Cat School), Dietician advice, and even house calls.</p>
							
							<p>Catitude is a privately owned clinic based in southern Brisbane. We’ve been around for 15 years 
							and have had great success in helping our clients solve their kitty problems. </p>
							
							<p>Our main area of expertise is in cat psychology and behaviour, more or less just trying to work out 
							the differences between owner and pet and try to make a healthy household for everyone.</p>

							<p>A cat behaviorist with more than fifteen years of experience, Jackson Supernova specializes in helping individuals whose “out of control” cats are turning their lives and homes upside down.</p>

							<p>At Catitude Clinic we have a licensed veterinarian and a cat behaviorist with certification (associate certified by the IAABC) and formal study in cat behavior that take the time to practice responsible and ethical behavior care for cats. We offer regular and drop in consultation appointments to provide you and your cat(s) an effective and all-encompassing behavior plan. Dedicated to the study of cat behavior, Catitude conducts behavior studies as part of many of our behavior consultations. This invaluable information benefits not only the consulting cat and owner, but also the lives of cats everywhere. Supernova has studied feline and animal behavior for 20 years, conducted behavior studies, and most recent study of animal behavior was at The University of Queensland.  He travels worldwide to lecture on cat behavior (most recently as the keynote speaker for the Humane Society and SPCA in Toronto, Canada behavior convention 2014) and in addition to working with the Animal Welfare League internationally, has authored a scholarly cited and science-based cat behavior book (Random House Publishing) with the latest strategies to help cats — as opposed to other cat behavior books filled with obsolete and incomplete advice you can easily find on the internet. </p>

							<p>Many people will tell you that it’s impossible to train or otherwise change the behavior of a cat. But over the last two decades our behaviorists have successfully applied a method consisting of compassionate awareness and three-part behavior modification to help resolve the unwanted behaviors of thousands of cats, and we’re here to show cat lovers that cats’ behavior can be reliably and consistently changed for the better. And we’ll show you exactly how using the uniquely effective three-stage method of solving every one of the seven major cat behavior problems.</p>

							<p>Our Philosophy: Cats are not like dogs. They are also not like humans. All cat behavior consulting has to start with this awareness. That’s because nearly all failed efforts to modify cats’ behavior assume that cat psychology is like dog psychology (or worse, like human psychology). These efforts are doomed to fail because they are based on ignorance of the uniqueness of individual cats and instinctual colony behavior dynamics. Cat behavior specialist Jackson Supernova is here to help you.
